## Pre-rendered videos

A pre-rendered video is a sequence in a video game that is not interactive, interrupting the gameplay. Nowadays they are usually used to introduce the game or its story and these videos are much less used nowadays for the following reasons:

-Pre-rendered videos take up more space.
-Nowadays it is faster and easier to use real-time rendered video.
-Videos rendered in real time can show changes that may have occurred in the story or modifications that the player may have made.

On the other hand these videos allow developers to deliver high-quality graphics and visual effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve in real-time, helping to create a more cinematic and emotionally resonant game world.

Let's see some examples of pre-rendered videos:

###Final Fantasy VII

The intro scene of Final Fantasy VII is a prerendered video. As mentioned before, this technique was mostly used in older video games. Yet it can still be seen in introductions or endings of video games.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
