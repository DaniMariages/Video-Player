## Pre-rendered videos

A pre-rendered video is a sequence in a video game that is not interactive, interrupting the gameplay. Nowadays they are usually used to introduce the game or its story and these videos are much less used nowadays for the following reasons:

-Pre-rendered videos take up more space.
-Nowadays it is faster and easier to use real-time rendered video.
-Videos rendered in real time can show changes that may have occurred in the story or modifications that the player may have made.

On the other hand these videos allow developers to deliver high-quality graphics and visual effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve in real-time, helping to create a more cinematic and emotionally resonant game world.

Let's see one example of a pre-rendered video:

### Final Fantasy VII

The intro scene of Final Fantasy VII is a prerendered video. As mentioned before, this technique was mostly used in older video games. Yet it can still be seen in introductions or endings of video games.

## OpenCV

OpenCV is a free computer vision library originally developed by Intel. OpenCV stands for Open Computer Vision. It offers algorithms that can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects among many other options. This time we will use it only to play a video.

### Why OpenCV?

I decided to use OpenCV after trying other more complicated and longer methods. With OpenCV we have the advantage that it is already prepared to play a video in a very fast and easy way. 

## TO DOs

```C++

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.
*   This is an unordered list following a header.

##### Header 5

1.  This is an ordered list following a header.
2.  This is an ordered list following a header.
3.  This is an ordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
